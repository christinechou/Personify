There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Mission ##
  > A tool that analyzes the emotional tone of written text


## Uses ##
  > For organizations or every day people who want to refine the tone of their message 
 

## Summary ##
  > Narrative analyzes given text and provides insights about the emotional, social and writing styles reflected in that text. This can be used for a variety of business or personal reasons including self-branding or marketing/PR communication efforts. Using Watsons's Tone Analyzer API, Narrative provides scores based on the text input separated into three dimensions: emotional, social, and writing style.  The emotional score is based on psychology models of measuring emotions such as anger, fear, anticipation, surprise, joy, sadness, trust, and disgust.  Social aspects capture the author's personality through the big five personality model. Finally, writing style and tone are measured on how analytical, confident, and tentative the writer's writing is.  Taken together, this tool can be used to analyze the underlying message of the text so you can adjust it to reflect desired tones.  For example, you may know that your readers are more extroverted and open to new experiences, so you can tailor your message to that specific audience.  Or, your highly confident yet tentative email to your roommate may suggest a certain propensity towards passive aggressiveness - good news is this will probably stop you from sending it, and perhaps - even better - provide you with a starting point to discuss it with him/her in person.

## Problem ##
  > A reader can be immediately turned off by the first few sentences of written text whether it was intended by the author or not. How a reader feels when reading an article, speech, or personal email is difficult to describe but its effects can distract him/her from the intended message or keep him/her from finishing it altogether.

## Solution ##
  > Helps you convey a message that isn't taken the wrong way.

## Slogan ##
  > Tell the narrative you want to tell.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Paste in your text and get results immediately.  View your iterations on one page to see how they have improved.
